 **# API Summary**

**API Functionalities:**

This API offers three primary endpoints:

1. **File Upload:** Enables users to upload documents for processing.
2. **File Summarization:** Generates concise summaries of uploaded documents.
3. **Document Question Answering:** Answers user-provided questions based on the content of uploaded documents.

**Data Preprocessing:**

To optimize API performance and accuracy, the raw data undergoes the following cleaning steps:

1. **Removal of non-word and non-number characters:** Excludes irrelevant symbols and characters.
2. **Punctuation removal:** Discards punctuation marks.
3. **Extra whitespace removal:** Normalizes spacing within the text.
4. **Tokenization:** Divides text into individual words or tokens for further processing.
5. **Stop word removal:** Eliminates common words (e.g., "the," "a," "and") that often have minimal semantic value.
6. **Lemmatization:** Reduces words to their base forms (e.g., "running" to "run") to enhance consistency and accuracy.

**Backend Improvements (Future Work):**

1. **Cloud Deployment:** Leverage AWS infrastructure for scalability and resource optimization.
2. **Distributed Processing:** Implement parallel processing techniques to distribute workloads across multiple nodes, enhancing performance and reducing processing time.
3. **Model Optimization:** Explore more efficient or specialized NLP models for summarization and question answering tasks.
4. **Caching:** Implement caching strategies to store frequently accessed data and reduce redundant computations, further boosting response times.
5. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected issues and provide informative error messages to users.
6. **Testing:** Establish a comprehensive testing suite to ensure API reliability and accuracy across various scenarios.
